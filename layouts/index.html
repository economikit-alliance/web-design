  <h3>ValueFlows GraphQL</h3>
  <h4>
      A new sociopolitical order needs a new measurement system. The ValueFlows protocol reimagines accounting as a rich multidimensional weave of attributable information that can be deeply representative of reality, whilst GraphQL brings these possibilities to the next generation of distributed computing. <br>

  <h3>Sacred Capital (the reputation economy)</h3>
  <h4>
      Reputation Infrastructure for the distributed economy. Sacred Capital is building a formal language for cultural articualtion, coupled with a 'Reputation Vault' that enables agents to port reputation data across contexts. By activating scalable reputation currencies, they hope to build a multi-dimensional wealth system in the long term. <br>

  <h3>Neighbourhoods</h3>
  <h4>
      An over-arching design principle for the distributed economy. 'Neighbourhoods' offers a new way to think about organising network of people and resources. By articulating 'specific culture' using 'generic tools' communities, apps and micro-networks build contextual pathways for the flow of capital and content.

  <h3>The Kit</h3>
  <h4>
      The journey toward a thriving future is long and unknowable. Our work in how we relate, who seeks us out and what we do together is to humbly make the creation of our own digital and economic freedoms accessible to all. <br>
      <br>
      We seek to make the organisation the kit, and the kit the organisation. To create artifacts through our lived experience and the guidance of others which empower groups of all kinds in radical and emancipatory ways.
